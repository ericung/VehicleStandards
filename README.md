# Vehicle Standards

### Introduction

In consideration of the revenue of a company, Manager Theory can take into account the cost of a product. 
Instead of using the cost of an employee, replace it with the product a company sells. 
In this article, we'll take some examples of vehicles, find their standard, and see what the numbers mean.

Sales means number of vehicles sold

MSRP means the cost of the standard

Standard = $`\sqrt[MSRP]{Sales}`$

StandardDifference = StandardOfYearA - StandardOfYearB

TotalSales = SalesOfYearA + SalesOfYearB

UnitDifference = TotalSales$`\times`$StandardDifference $`\equiv`$ Cost per unit difference between YearA and YearB
