# Vehicle Standards

### Introduction

In consideration of the revenue of a company, Manager Theory can take into account the cost of a product. 
Instead of using the cost of an employee, replace it with the product a company sells. 
In this article, we'll take some examples of vehicles, find their standard, and see what the numbers mean.

Sales means number of vehicles sold

MSRP means the cost of the standard

Standard = $`\sqrt[MSRP]{Sales}`$

StandardDifference = StandardOfYearA - StandardOfYearB

TotalSales = SalesOfYearA + SalesOfYearB

UnitDifference = TotalSales$`\times`$StandardDifference $`\equiv`$ Cost per unit difference between YearA and YearB

### Corolla

**2022**

Sales = 222,216

MSRP = [20425,28710]

Standard = $`\sqrt[20175]{222216}`$ = 1.0006104169677

**2021**

Sales = 248993

MSRP = [20025,28310]

Standard = $`\sqrt[20025]{248993}`$ = 1.0000397799688

**Difference between 2021 and 2022**

StandardDifference = 1.0000397799688 - 1.0006104169677 = -0.00057063699888271

TotalSales = = 471,209

UnitDifference = TotalSales$`\times`$StandardDifference = -268.88928960652

Conclusion: Corolla lost $268.89 per unit between 2021 and 2022.

### Mustang 2022

**2022**

Sales = 44,332

MSRP = [27470,55270]

Standard = $`\sqrt[27470]{44332}`$ = 1.0002305789969

**2021**

Sales = 52,414

MSRP = [27205,52400]

Standard = $`\sqrt[27205]{52414}`$ = 1.0003995258105

**Difference between 2021 and 2022**

StandardDifference = 1.0002305789969 - 1.0003995258105 = 

TotalSales = = 471,209

UnitDifference = TotalSales$`\times`$StandardDifference = -79.609304895941

Conclusion: Mustang lost $79.61 per unit between 2021 and 2022.
